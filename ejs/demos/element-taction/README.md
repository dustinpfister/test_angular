# Element tAction

In this demo I wanted to make a timed action element. It uses a template that has an input button, and it also uses a canvas element to display the progress of a timed action. This is something that I aim to uses in one of my angularjs games, and maybe not something that involves scripting http, but we will see where it goes.

```html
<x-taction
 
    time = "1000"
 
>
</x-taction>
```
