## Money

This is the first game for my test_angular project. It is a simple incremental game, that makes use of controllers, and a shared object between them made with angular.factory.


## Work a job button

The work a job button represents preforming manual work. It is something that you do to make a little money, but once the job is over thats it. Over time nothing more is gained once the job is complete, and the only way to make more money is to just keep working.

## Write a Blog Post Button.

The write a blog post button will create a single blog post each time it is clicked. The act of writing the post itself will not make you any money, however it will increase your post count. For each game tick a certain amount of passive income is generated, and a higher post count will increase that income.
